Hi! Recently i was needing to convert some images from my iPhone saved as .heic and my computer was not able to read them.  
So i needed to convert them to .jpg or any other possible format.  
For my surprise, i found just a few websites/softwares which does this work, but most of them is paid, so I decided to create this repository/application.
